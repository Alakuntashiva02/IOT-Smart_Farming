# IOT Smart Farming System

Smart farming, which is based on IoT technologies, allows growers and farmers to reduce waste while increasing productivity. Smart farming solutions are designed to monitor crop fields using sensors (light, humidity, etc.).

Temperature, soil moisture, crop health, and so on) as well as automating the irrigation system. For example, if the soil moisture level falls, the farmer can use sensors to begin irrigation. The ability to predict production output allows for better product distribution planning. A smart greenhouse that monitors and controls the climate does away with the need for manual intervention. Predictive analytics in agriculture.


### The Installation Procedure

- Download the project source files as a zip file or clone the project with the git clone command.
- Install mysql client on your computer and import the 'data store.sql' file into your sql client (you can also use an online mysql service) 
- that project is entirely written in Java, and you must install JDK before using it.
- If you do not want to use source files, you can use the.exe installer, which will automatically install java with the application. 
- The devices folder contains all ardiuno source files related to the system. 
- The Python Core Folder contains the application, which acts as a bridge between sensors and the database server, execute run.bat in this folder 
- Run Iceburg Application and change database settings related to you
### Sensor Box - 1

Sensor Box one includes two sensors
- DHT11 OR DHT22
- MQ135 Gas Sensor

We collecting several data using above two sensors
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Heat Index (also known as feel like)
- Gas Level (P.P.M - Parts Per Million)
