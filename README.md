# IOT Smart Farming System

Smart farming based on IoT technologies enables growers and farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity ranging from the quantity of fertilizer utilized to the number of journeys the farm vehicles have made, and enabling efficient utilization of resources such as water, electricity, etc. IoT smart farming solutions is a system that is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, crop health, etc.) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. They can also select between manual and automated options for taking necessary actions based on this data. For example, if the soil moisture level decreases, the farmer can deploy sensors to start the irrigation. Smart farming is highly efficient when compared with the conventional approach.

IoT have the potential to transform agriculture in many aspects and these are the main ones.

Data collected by smart agriculture sensors, in this approach of farm management, a key component are sensors, control systems, robotics, autonomous vehicles, automated hardware, variable rate technology, motion detectors, button camera, and wearable devices. This data can be used to track the state of the business in general as well as staff performance, equipment efficiency. The ability to foresee the output of production allows to plan for better product distribution.

Agricultural Drones Ground-based and aerial-based drones are being used in agriculture in order to enhance various agricultural practices: crop health assessment, irrigation, crop monitoring, crop spraying, planting, and soil and field analysis.

Livestock tracking and geofencing Farm owners can utilize wireless IoT applications to collect data regarding the location, well-being, and health of their cattle. This information helps to prevent the spread of disease and also lowers labor costs.

Smart Greenhouses A smart greenhouse designed with the help of IoT intelligently monitors as well as controls the climate, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Predictive analytics for smart farming Crop predication plays a key role, it helps the farmer to decide future plan regarding the production of the crop, its storage, marketing techniques and risk management. To predict production rate of the crop artificial network use information collected by sensors from the farm. This information includes parameters such as soil, temperature, pressure, rainfall, and humidity. The farmers can get an accurate soil data either by the dashboard or a customized mobile application.

Farmers have started to realize that the IoT is a driving force for increasing agricultural production in a cost-effective way.

Because the market is still developing, there is still ample opportunity for businesses willing to join in


## Sensor Box 01 Details

Sensor Box one includes two sensors 

* DHT11 OR DHT22
* MQ135 Gas Sensor

we collecting sevaral data using above two sensors

* Temparature
* Humidity
* Heat Index (also known  as feel like)
* Gas Level(P.P.M - Parts Per Million)
 
### DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor Overview

#### DHT11 Sensor

The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). Its fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, the sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.

```Compared to the DHT22, this sensor is less precise, less accurate, and works in a smaller range of temperature/humidity, but it is smaller and less expensive.```

Technical Details

* Low cost
* 3V to 5V power and I/O
* 2.5mA max current use during conversion (while requesting data)
* Good for 20-80% humidity readings with 5% accuracy
* Good for 0-50°C temperature readings ±2°C accuracy
* No more than 1 Hz sampling rate (once every second)
* Body size 15.5mm x 12mm x 5.5mm
* 4 pins with 0.1" spacing

#### MQ-135 Gas Sensor

The MQ-135 Gas sensor can detect gases like Ammonia (NH3), sulfur (S), Benzene (C6H6), CO2, and other harmful gases and smoke. Similar to other MQ series gas sensor, this sensor also has a digital and analog output pin. When the level of these gases go beyond a threshold limit in the air the digital pin goes high. This threshold value can be set by using the on-board potentiometer. The analog output pin, outputs an analog voltage which can be used to approximate the level of these gases in the atmosphere.

The MQ135 air quality sensor module operates at 5V and consumes around 150mA. It requires some pre-heating before it could actually give accurate results.


Details of MQ135 Sensor

The MQ135 is one of the popular gas sensors from the MQ series of sensors that are commonly used in air quality control equipment. It operates from 2.5V to 5.0V and can provide both digital and analog output. The pinouts and important components on an MQ135 Module is marked below

```Note that all MQ sensors have to be powered up for a pre-heat duration for the sensor to warm up before it can start working. This pre-heat time is normally between 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. When you power up the module the power LED will turn on, leave the module in this state till the pre-heat duration is completed.```


Technical Specifications of MQ135 Gas Sensor

* Operating Voltage: 2.5V to 5.0V
